# Window

-   [wininstall](https://winstall.app/) - Bulk install Windows apps quickly with Windows Package Manager.
-   [SuperF4](https://stefansundin.github.io/superf4/) - SuperF4 kills the foreground program when you press Ctrl+Alt+F4. This is different from when you press Alt+F4. When you press Alt+F4, the program can refuse to quit. Windows only asks the program to quit, and lets it decide for itself what to do.
